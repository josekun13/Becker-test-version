# Becker-test-version
The purpose of this robot is to test and develop human-robot interaction
applications, also control models for non-linear systems.
## Introduction
R.Becker :smiley_cat: is an inverted pendulum on two wheels, the idea of
this kind of design is the dynamically stable robots are inherently safe 
to work in human environments.

Inverted pendulum on two wheels

The inverted pendulum is the simplest version of an dynamically stable 
robot.

The operation of Becker consist in an IMU that measure the inclination
angle, a control module and two DC. motors that correct the disturbances
